Module 6 - Challenge 6 : Proptech Dysfunction Junction
=============================================

## Purpose

 The purpose of this notebook is to use data viz, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities. 

---

## Technologies

Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas data analysis library were used in the creation of this project. The Mapbox API was leveraged to display results of a price per square foot vs gross rent analysis.

---

## Installation Guide

First, install the jupyter and pandas libraries. In your terminal or command shell install the following packages: 

```python
pip install jupyter
```

```python
pip install pandas
```

```python
pip install numpy
```

```python
pip install hvplot
```

```python
pip install plotly
```


In order for this simulation to work, the user needs to create a .env file containing their Mapbox API key. 

This notebook was created using python 3.7.10. There were a number of issues with the packages within this specific conda environment, and I definitely taking time to troubleshoot any package discrepencies that may arise. 

---

## Conclusion

Contained within the notebook are the results of the analysis.
